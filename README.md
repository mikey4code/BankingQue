# BankingQue

Banking Que is the name of the project and the goal of this project is to make an easy and smooth banking experience for customers and enforce the idea of social distancing in this current pandemic. The customers will be able to Register or Login, open a new account, get a credit card, debit card, transfer between accounts from the comforts of their car. 

We came up with the idea of creating a waiting queue that will put the cusutomer in the queue if they make a transaction. With this queue, a bank rep will be able to invite them into the bank when it is safe to do so. bank rep will aslo be able to genrate CSV reports of customer transactions.

With this system it will reduce the wait time in the bank when it comes to helping the customers and waiting in line.
